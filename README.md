# 42 Cursus Project: Libft

## Introduction

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to the highly useful standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.
Take the time to expand your **libft** throughout the year. However, when working on a new project, don’t forget to ensure the functions used in your library are allowed in the project guidelines.

## Commands

- `make` - create library without bonus files
- `make bonus` - create library with bonus files
- `make clean` - delete object files
- `make fclean` - delete object and binary files
- `make re` - delete object, binary files, and create library without bonus files
- `make re bonus` - delete object, binary files, and create library with bonus files
